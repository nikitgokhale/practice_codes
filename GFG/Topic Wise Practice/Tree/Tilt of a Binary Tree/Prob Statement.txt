Given a binary tree of size N+1, your task is to complete the function tiltTree(), that return the tilt of the whole tree. The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null nodes are assigned tilt to be zero. Therefore, tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes’ tilt.

Examples:

Input :
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output : 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : 0
Tilt of node 3 : 0
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

Input :
    4
   / \
  2   9
 / \   \
3   5   7
Output : 15
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 3 : 0
Tilt of node 5 : 0
Tilt of node 7 : 0
Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = 6
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
Input:
The function takes a single argument as input, the reference pointer to the root of the binary tree.
There will be T test cases, and for each test case the function will be called separately.

Output:
For each test case output the tilt of the binary tree on a new line.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
0<=N<=500
